## How We Use Information

### Purposes

- Any purpose beyond error reporting

---

## Information Sharing

### Who Receives Data

Error reports are sent only to:
- **Module authors:** Only for their own modules, and only if you've consented
- **Configured endpoints:** Only endpoints you've explicitly enabled

### How Sharing Works

- **Author-specific routing:** Errors are only sent to the author of the module that caused them
- **User control:** You can enable/disable any author endpoint
- **No third parties:** Data is never shared with advertising, analytics, or other third-party services

### Third-Party Services

Some module authors may use third-party services (like Sentry) to process error reports. Each author is responsible for:
- Disclosing their data handling practices
- Complying with applicable privacy laws
- Providing their own privacy policies

---

## Data Security

### Transmission Security

- **HTTPS required:** All error reports are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections
- **No insecure transmission:** Module will not send data over unencrypted connections
- **Certificate validation:** Standard browser security applies to all transmissions

### Local Security

- **Foundry storage:** Settings stored in Foundry VTT's secure module storage
- **No external storage:** No data stored outside your local Foundry installation
- **User-controlled:** All settings and preferences are under your direct control

### Anonymous by Design

- **No user identifiers:** No usernames, IDs, or persistent identifiers collected
- **Session rotation:** Anonymous session IDs rotate daily
- **Correlation protection:** No way to link multiple sessions to the same user

---

## Data Retention

### Our Retention

- **Local settings:** Retained until you change them or uninstall the module
- **Session IDs:** Automatically rotate every 24 hours
- **No personal data:** No personal data to retain long-term

### Author Retention

Each module author who receives error reports is responsible for:
- Setting appropriate data retention periods
- Implementing data deletion procedures
- Complying with applicable data protection laws
- Documenting their retention practices

**Recommended practices for authors:**
- Maximum 12 months retention for debugging purposes
- Automatic deletion of old error reports
- No correlation of errors across extended time periods
