# Documentation Plan: Errors and Echoes

## Overview
This plan addresses all documentation gaps for the `fvtt-errors-and-echoes` module before GitHub publication. The module handles privacy-sensitive error reporting, making comprehensive documentation critical for user trust and developer adoption.

## Phase 1 Completion Status ✅
**Completed December 6, 2024**

### Artifacts Created:
- **SECURITY.md** - Vulnerability reporting process, security best practices, threat model
- **README_FOUNDRY.md** - Comprehensive user guide with privacy transparency, installation, configuration
- **LEGAL-COMPLIANCE.md** - GDPR compliance documentation, data retention policies, user rights
- **PRIVACY-POLICY.md** - Formal privacy policy covering data collection, use, sharing, and user rights

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ Complete privacy transparency for end users
- ✅ GDPR compliance framework established
- ✅ Security vulnerability reporting process
- ✅ User-friendly privacy explanations at multiple levels
- ✅ Legal framework covering US (Maryland) and EU requirements
- ✅ Anonymous-by-design architecture documented
