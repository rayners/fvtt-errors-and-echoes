## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-03

### Fixed

- **Quench Test Suite** - Resolved all failing integration tests for complete test coverage
- **Network Request Timeouts** - Added 5-second timeout to endpoint testing to prevent test hanging
- **Error Attribution Accuracy** - Fixed test expectations to match actual attribution behavior when called from module context

- **Promise Rejection Handling** - Improved unhandled promise rejection test to prevent console pollution

### Improved

- **Error Reporter Resilience** - Enhanced `testEndpoint` method with proper timeout handling and abort controller
- **Test Reliability** - Simplified window error capture test to avoid Foundry v13 deprecation warning cascades
- **Attribution Logic** - Better handling of stack trace analysis when errors originate from module test context
- **Debugging Output** - Added comprehensive console logging for test debugging and failure analysis

### Technical

- **AbortController Integration** - Modern fetch timeout handling for better network request management
- **Test Isolation** - Improved test cleanup and error handler management to prevent interference
- **Error Boundary Testing** - More robust testing of edge cases and error conditions
- **JSON Response Parsing** - Better handling of non-JSON responses from invalid endpoints

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
