### Day 3-4: Documentation & Testing
**Focus**: Align documentation with implementation
- Update all API documentation to reflect complete features
- Add end-to-end testing scenarios
- Validate all documentation examples work correctly

### Day 5-7: Release Preparation
**Focus**: Production readiness
- Final security audit and load testing
- Version bumping and changelog completion
- Deployment documentation and release artifacts

- [ ] Performance validated under load
- [ ] Deployment documentation complete

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risk Items
**Registration API Core**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - No risk, fully implemented and tested
**Security Features**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - No risk, comprehensive implementation

### Medium Risk Items
**Settings UI**: Foundry UI integration complexity
- *Mitigation*: Use existing UI patterns, test thoroughly
**Integration Examples**: Module compatibility variations
- *Mitigation*: Test with multiple modules, provide fallback patterns

### Potential Blockers
**Module Testing Access**: Need actual modules for integration testing
- *Mitigation*: Use existing J&J and R&R modules for testing
**Performance Requirements**: Unclear production load expectations
- *Mitigation*: Test with reasonable estimates, document performance characteristics

## Deliverables Checklist

### Code Artifacts
- [ ] Enhanced settings UI (`src/settings-ui.ts`)
- [ ] Integration examples (`examples/` directory)
- [ ] End-to-end tests (`test/e2e.test.ts`)
- [ ] Performance optimizations (if needed)

### Documentation Artifacts
- [ ] Updated `API-REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Updated `README.md` and `README_FOUNDRY.md`
- [ ] Complete `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Updated `TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] New `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`

### Release Artifacts
- [ ] Version 1.0.0 tags
- [ ] Release notes
- [ ] Deployment packages
- [ ] Security assessment report

## Quality Gates
