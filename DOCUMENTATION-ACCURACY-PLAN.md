# Documentation Accuracy & Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to address significant discrepancies between documentation claims and actual implementation in both `fvtt-errors-and-echoes` and `sentry-relay` projects.

## Critical Issues Summary

### fvtt-errors-and-echoes
- Core registration API documented but unimplemented (stub only)
- Testing infrastructure claimed but non-existent
- Status marked "COMPLETE" despite missing major features
- Integration documentation assumes non-functional APIs

### sentry-relay
- Security features extensively documented but unimplemented
- Rate limiting, input validation, data sanitization missing
- CORS configuration ignored
- Claims adherence to fictional API standards

## Phase 1: Immediate Documentation Corrections (Priority: CRITICAL) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: January 6, 2025
**Status**: All critical documentation corrections applied successfully

### 1.1 fvtt-errors-and-echoes Status Correction ‚úÖ
- [x] Update `ERRORS-AND-ECHOES-STATUS.md`:
  - Changed "‚úÖ COMPLETE" to "üöß PHASE 1 COMPLETE - ‚è≥ PHASE 2 PENDING"
  - Updated module status to reflect Registration API is unimplemented (stub only)
  - Documented actual completion status per feature
- [x] Add implementation status badges to `README.md`
  - Added comprehensive feature status matrix
  - Highlighted working vs. missing/stub features
  - Updated Quick Start to show only implemented features

### 1.2 sentry-relay Security Disclaimer ‚úÖ
- [x] Add prominent security warning to `README.md`:
  - Added security warning block at top of document
  - Listed specific missing security features
  - Marked as "NOT PRODUCTION-READY"
- [x] Remove or clearly mark unimplemented security sections
  - Marked security features as "Planned" vs. implemented
  - Updated implementation claims throughout documentation
- [x] Add "Proof of Concept" designation throughout documentation

### 1.3 Remove Fictional Standards Claims ‚úÖ
- [x] Remove references to "Foundry VTT Error Reporting API v1.0 specification"
- [x] Replace with "reference API specification" or "reference implementation"
- [x] Update language from "standard" to "example" or "reference"
- [x] Updated integration documentation and help links

## Phase 2: Implementation Priority Assessment

### 2.1 fvtt-errors-and-echoes - Determine Path Forward
**Option A: Complete the Implementation**
- Implement full `register()` API as documented
- Add comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Complete integration examples

**Option B: Adjust Scope**
- Focus on manual reporting as primary use case
- Document registration API as "planned feature"
- Update integration guides to focus on working functionality

**Recommendation**: Option B for immediate release, Option A for future roadmap

### 2.2 sentry-relay - Security Implementation Plan
**Critical Security Features (Must Implement)**
- Rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper CORS origin validation
- Request size limits

**Nice-to-Have Features**
- Structured logging
- Health monitoring enhancements
- Flexible author routing

## Phase 3: Documentation Restructuring

### 3.1 fvtt-errors-and-echoes Documentation
- [ ] Split `README.md` into current vs planned features
- [ ] Create separate `INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` for working manual integration
- [ ] Move registration API docs to `FUTURE-API.md` or similar
- [ ] Update examples to use only implemented features

### 3.2 sentry-relay Documentation
- [ ] Restructure README with clear "Implemented" vs "Planned" sections
- [ ] Move security features to implementation roadmap
- [ ] Update curl examples to reflect actual capabilities
- [ ] Mark alternative implementations as "templates" not "complete examples"

## Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap

### 4.1 fvtt-errors-and-echoes Implementation Tasks
**If pursuing Option A (Complete Implementation):**
- [ ] Design and implement module registration system
- [ ] Add context provider infrastructure
- [ ] Implement error filtering capabilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Create integration examples for popular modules

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks full-time development

### 4.2 sentry-relay Security Implementation
**Critical Path (Production-Ready)**
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Implement data sanitization pipeline
- [ ] Fix CORS configuration to respect environment variables
- [ ] Add request size limits

**Enhanced Features**
- [ ] Structured logging system
- [ ] Health check improvements
- [ ] Configurable author routing
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks for critical path, additional week for enhancements

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Documentation Review Process
- [ ] Implement documentation review checklist
- [ ] Cross-reference all claims with actual implementation
- [ ] Add automated documentation testing where possible
- [ ] Regular audits of documentation accuracy

### 5.2 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add unit tests for documented features
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Documentation examples as executable tests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for documentation validation

## Implementation Decision Matrix

| Project | Current State | Recommended Action | Timeline |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| fvtt-errors-and-echoes | Core functional, API missing | Update docs first, implement later | 1 week docs, 3 weeks implementation |
| sentry-relay | PoC with security gaps | Immediate security warning, then implement | 1 day warning, 2 weeks implementation |

## Success Criteria

### Documentation Accuracy
- [ ] No claims for unimplemented features
- [ ] Clear distinction between current and planned capabilities
- [ ] All examples use only implemented functionality
- [ ] Security posture accurately represented

### Implementation Completeness
- [ ] All documented features are implemented
- [ ] Security features match documentation claims
- [ ] Testing coverage matches documentation promises
- [ ] Integration examples work as described

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Users relying on documented but unimplemented features**
   - Mitigation: Immediate documentation corrections
2. **Security vulnerabilities in sentry-relay**
   - Mitigation: Prominent security warnings, rapid implementation
3. **Reputation damage from inaccurate documentation**
   - Mitigation: Transparent communication about status

### Communication Strategy
- Clear changelog documenting corrections
- Honest communication about implementation status
- Regular updates on implementation progress
- Acknowledgment of documentation issues

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - Add security warning to sentry-relay
   - Update status documentation for errors-and-echoes
   - Remove fictional API standard claims

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Complete documentation restructuring
   - Decide on implementation vs scope adjustment
   - Begin critical security implementations

3. **Medium Term (Next Month)**
   - Complete chosen implementation path
   - Establish documentation accuracy processes
   - Update all related documentation sites

## Conclusion

Both projects have solid foundational implementations but require significant documentation corrections and, in some cases, security implementations to match their documented capabilities. The plan prioritizes user safety and accurate expectations while providing a clear path forward for both projects.
